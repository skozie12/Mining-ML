# Models Directory

This directory stores trained machine learning models.

## Saved Models:
Models are saved as `.joblib` files for easy loading and deployment.

Examples:
- `logistic_regression.joblib`
- `random_forest.joblib`
- `xgboost.joblib`
- `lightgbm.joblib`

Run `python src/models/train_model.py` to train and save models.
